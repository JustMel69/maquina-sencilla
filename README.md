### Simple computer emulator
This repo contains an emulator for a machine that only has 4 instructions: ```ADD, MOV CMP``` and ```BEQ ```(branch if equals) and 128x16 bits RAM
The code is completely functional but **currently** it does not have a user interface, it can serve as a great educational resource as it is (mostly) very readable.

Check tests for example usage
